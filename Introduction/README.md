## In this folder there are indications on the tools and how to install them

In Instructions_Linux.md and Instructions_Windows you will find the setup for Linux (Ubuntu 20.04) and Windows 10, respectively.

Some notes:

1) ⚠️ `**It is strongly recommended to use Linux.**` ⚠️	

2) There are no instructions for MacOSX, but in many ways it is similar to Linux, ask to the teacher :-) .

3) In addition to the above software, you need a text editor to edit the code. The choice is personal, you can use the one you feel most comfortable with.

4) The ultimate goal is to have a jupyter notebook where the following command works:

    import ROOT
