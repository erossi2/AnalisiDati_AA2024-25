## In this folder there are indications on the tools and how to install them

In Linux.md and Windows.md you will find the setup for Linux (Ubuntu 20.04) and Windows 10, respectively. In MacOS.md instruction for MacOSSonoma 14.5 can be found.

Some notes:

1) ⚠️ `**It is strongly recommended to use Linux or MacOS.**` ⚠️	

2) If in instruction for MacOS there is something missing ask suggestion to the teacher :-) .

3) In addition to the above software, you need a text editor to edit the code. The choice is personal, you can use the one you feel most comfortable with.

4) The ultimate goal is to have a jupyter notebook where the following command works:

    import ROOT
